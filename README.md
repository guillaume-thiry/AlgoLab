# Algorithms Lab Fall 21 - All problems and complete solutions

### This is my personal repository containing all the problems and solutions of the course Algorithms Lab from ETH ZÃ¼rich that I completed in the Fall semester 2021

Each week, four new problems were released with 2 weeks to be completed. An extra problem, called Problem of the Week (**PotW**), was released every Monday with only 2 hours to do it.

Because the algorithmic reasoning is already hard enough in these problems, the code in itself tries to be as clear and basic as possible (no writing optimization, no more libraries than needed).

All the solutions in this repository give the full **100 points**.
